Tried aggregator 2 times.
MIP Presolve eliminated 183770 rows and 279473 columns.
Aggregator did 79808 substitutions.
All rows and columns eliminated.
Presolve time = 0,32 sec. (280,12 ticks)

Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =    0,35 sec. (302,97 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 8 threads:
  Real time             =    0,00 sec. (0,00 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    0,00 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0,00 sec.
