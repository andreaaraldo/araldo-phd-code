Tried aggregator 2 times.
MIP Presolve eliminated 183827 rows and 282817 columns.
Aggregator did 81024 substitutions.
All rows and columns eliminated.
Presolve time = 0.87 sec. (283.21 ticks)

Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =    0.93 sec. (306.32 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 8 threads:
  Real time             =    0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
